\chapter{Data and Simulation}
\label{ch:MC}
	In almost every particle physics analysis data is compared to simulations. Physicists have to rely on simulations because it is not possible to purely calculate the outcome visible in the detector. In this chapter, the used data set as well as the considered Monte Carlo simulation samples are introduced.
	\section{Data}
	This thesis analyses data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of $13\;\text{TeV}$. The size of the data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $37.76\;\text{fb}^{-1}$. A detailed view of the data taking over time is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:CMS_lumi}. It is shown that the majority of events provided by LHC is recorded with CMS. To use recorded data in an analysis, it is required to pass a quality criterion. For this, only data from selected runs are used where the accelerator and detector worked properly.

	\section{Monte Carlo Samples}
	Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to be able to see influences of selections in all relevant processes. Simulations provide an estimate of the outcome of a collision as it would be seen in the detector. This level is called reconstruction or detector level throughout this analysis. Furthermore, simulations also provide information on particle level, meaning the physical process after hadronisation but without detector effects and pile-up. This is as well referred to as generator level. The most important simulation for this analysis is of course the $t\bar{t}$ sample which will be used to provide an input for the unfolding procedure. Since the lepton+jets channel is selected, processes that have a similar final state (exactly one lepton and (b-) jets) have to be included. The background processes considered in this work are: Single Top production, $W$+jets production, $Z$+jets production, Diboson production and general QCD events. These processes are relevant in the final phase space because leptons are possible in the final state. Most dominant processes are expected to be $W$+jets and Single Top production, because they provide a process with exactly one detectable lepton in the final state and additional jets. $Z$+jets production is reduced by vetoing additional leptons. Diboson production has a very low cross section, but $WW$ and $WZ$ can lead to a similar final state as $t\bar{t}$. QCD is expected to produce mostly leptons with small transverse momenta and is therefore reduced by selecting a lepton in the high energy region. Table \ref{MC_Tab} summarises every considered MC sample with additional information like MC generator, cross section and number of events the sample contains. Every process is split into different regions to obtain enough statistics, even in high energy regions.

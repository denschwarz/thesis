\section{Experiment}
\subsection{Large Hadron Collider}
	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular particle collider with a circumference of $27\;\text{km}$. 
	
	Four Experiments are placed at the interaction points of LHC.

\subsubsection{Tracker}
	%ABMAßE TRACKER, ANZAHL LAYER USW
	The purpose of the tracking system is to measure the momentum of created particles. It is taken advantage of the Lorentz force which changes the momentum of charged particles in a magnetic field. Paths of those particles are therefore bended with a bending radius proportional to the momentum in a constant magnetic field. Therefore a solenoid provides a constant magnetic field of about $4\;\text{T}$ inside the tracker. Per path one spatial point per layer is measured. These points are the input for a track finding algorithm.

\subsubsection{Calorimeters}
	To define the type of particle one has to measure not only momentum but also energy. Therefore outside the tracker are two types of calorimeters installed.

\subsubsection{Solenoid}
	Outside the hadronic calorimeter a superconducting solenoid is installed and provides a magnetic field of about $4\;\text{T}$ inside the tracking system. The solenoid has a length of $13\;\text{m}$ and a diameter of $6\;\text{m}$. The purpose of the magnetic field is to bend paths of charged particles due to the Lorentz force. The bending radius then is directly connected to the momentum of the particle.  
\subsubsection{Muon System}
	Because muons are not absorbed in the calorimeters, it is possible to use an additional tracking detector for muons at the very outside of the detector. Muon chambers are embedded in the iron return yoke of the magnet. Thus a magnetic field of about $2\;\text{T}$ is present.
	%AUFBAU MUON SYSTEM
	In cooperation with the inner tracker it is possible to reconstruct muon momenta with high precision.
\subsubsection{Trigger}
	At the interaction point centred in the CMS detector every ???? 
	%BUNCHRATE
	proton bunches cross. Per crossing about ????
	%INTERACTIONNUMBER
	interactions take place. This adds up to about ???
	%COLLISIONS PER SECOND
	interactions per second. This huge collision rate makes it impossible to store information of every event on disk. Additionally it would need a tremendous number of computing cores to analyse this data. Therefore a trigger system is installed to select the most interesting events to reduce the amount of data. For the computation system it is required to reduce the amount from ???? to ????.
	%RATE VOR UND NACH TRIGGER
 	To decide which events are worth storing and which will be neglected different criteria are defined.

\chapter{Unfolding}
\label{ch:unfolding}
	Most analyses at LHC measure distributions of appropriate variables and then compare the obtained results in data with event simulations. In this method the MC samples also include detector effects. What one measures in this case is the real distribution on particle level folded with an unknown detector function. Studying the difference in MC between particle level and reconstruction level, it is possible to calculate the probabilities that a measured value in a bin $x_i$ is originating from bin $y_i$ on particle level. The resulting matrix can then be applied to real data to obtain data on particle level. The obtained distribution is corrected for detector effects by the unfolding and can then be compared with theory calculations. Additionally, measurements on particle level do not depend on simulation ambiguities like the mass parameter put into the Monte-Carlo generator.

\chapter{Summary and Outlook}

	The analysis performing a measurement of the jet mass distribution in boosted top quark decays has been presented. Studies of various jet clustering algorithms were performed to find the most suitable jet definition. The influence of the jet radius on Anti-$k_T$ jets as well as jet mass distributions obtained by using HOTVR jets were examined and finally compared to a novel clustering method, namely XCone. The exclusive approach of XCone is used to define a specialised jet finding method for this analysis. This method proofed to be very successful in reconstructing hadronically decaying top quarks, returning a jet mass distribution with a narrow peak at the top quark mass. Together with high statistics and a large fraction of jets containing all decay, the jet mass distribution on particle level acts as very promising input for the unfolding procedure. \\
	On reconstruction level, baseline criteria are defined to select a preferably pure $t\bar{t}$ sample. Additionally, a further selection is applied defining a measurement phase space with boosted top quark decays. The jet mass distribution after passing every selection criterium shows is nice features on reconstruction level as well. Furthermore, also pile-up is not effecting the distribution much, indicating a well suited input for an unfolding procedure. In addition, jet energy corrections for XCone jets were derived. Based on AK4 corrections, that are expected behave similarly to XCone subjets with the same radius, a correction factor was obtained. The $p_T$ and $\eta$ dependent correction was found via a matching from reconstructed jets to jets on particle level in simulation. After validation with the well known $W$ boson mass, the new jet energy corrections are applied to every measured jet.\\	
	A first unfolding approach was tested with Monte Carlo samples. Unfolding of a simulation with itself confirmed a correctly filled migration matrix. Though, a check with independent samples indicated a modelling dependent bias. It expected to solve this issue with a further extended migration matrix, including migrations from lower jet $p_T$ regions. In addition, the binning of the matrix is not examined yet. Here, purity and stability are useful and recommended measures to define a well suited binning scheme. With simulations from different generators, a model dependency can be validated and better understood. Furthermore, the electron + jets channel can be added to this analysis to increase statistics and systematic uncertainties have to be covered to present a result. \\
	After obtaining a well understood unfolded distribution, a top quark mass can be extracted. First tests with simulations of different mass points but especially comparisons with theory calculations are planned in the future of this analysis. Calculations are not yet available for LHC but the use of XCone jets will certainly be preferred by theorist because of a clustering based on N-jettiness.

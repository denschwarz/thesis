\chapter{Reconstruction of Objects}
\label{ch:Reco}
	From all kinds of information provided by the detector systems has to be interpreted as physical objects in order to analyse the recorded data. Therefore algorithms are run to link the information from the detector to usable objects like muons, electrons or jets. Objects are defined by their detection in different detector systems. Paths of all detectable objects through the detector are sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:CMS_reco}.

\section{Particle Flow}
\label{sec:pf}
	CMS uses a special algorithm called particle flow \cite{particleflow} to combine information from tracker and calorimeters and thus reconstruct objects to a high precision. Tracks from the inner tracker are extrapolated into the calorimeters. If a shower fits to the track, information from these two sub detectors are combined. Since only charged particles will interact with the tracking system, showers from neutral hadrons and photons cannot be associated with a track.
\section{Electrons}
	Electrons are reconstructed in the tracker and electromagnetic calorimeter. Due to the magnetic field, electrons will take a curved path through the tracking system. They are then stopped in the ECAL where their energy is measured.
\section{Muons}
	Muons have a very low probability to interact with the Calorimeters of CMS. Because of that, muons are identified by hits in the muon chambers. Combining informations from the muon system and the inner tracker leads to a very precise measurement of muons in the CMS detector. Therefore muons are very reliable objects in CMS data analyses. An object is announced a muon if %todo KRITERIEN MUON
\section{Jets}
	Jets are objects, used to reconstruct quarks. Because of confinement quarks cannot exist isolated but hadronize. This results in a particle shower consisting of hadrons. To reconstruct the initial quark one needs to sum up all particles from the final shower. To combine the tracks in a well defined way jet algorithms are used. Two important requirements for an jet algorithm are to be infrared and collinear safe. The first criterion means, a jet should not change when including or excluding soft radiation. Collinear safety addresses collinear splitting of particles in a jet which should also not change the jet. All presented jet algorithms in this thesis fulfil these requirements.
\subsection{Anti-$k_T$ and Cambridge/Aachen Jet Algorithms}
	In CMS the common way to cluster jets from the detected particles is to use iterative jet algorithms. Thus particles are clustered step by step until an abort criterion is reached. The most common group of iterative jet algorithms are $k_T$-like algorithms. As an input, a list of objects reconstructed in the detector is given. The Algorithm then calculates two quantities $d_{ij}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:dij}) and $d_{iB}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:iB}) for each pair of objects $i$ and $j$:
	\begin{equation}
	d_{ij} = min (k_{T,i}^{n}, k_{T,j}^{n})  \frac{\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2}
	\label{eq:dij}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	d_{iB} = k_{T,i}^{-n}.
	\label{eq:iB}
	\end{equation}
	Here, $d_{ij}$ describes a effective distance between two objects $i$ and $j$, $d_{iB}$ is a distance measure from object to beam axis. The variable $k_T$ is the transverse momentum of an object, $\Delta R_{ij}$ denotes the distance between objects $i$ and $j$ and $R$ is a constant parameter that defines the radius of the resulting jet. Changing the exponent $n$ influences the order of clustering. If $n=-2$, the algorithm is called Anti-$k_T$ \cite{antikt} and particles with high transverse momenta are clustered first. Using the Cambridge/Aachen \cite{CA1, CA2} algorithm, and therefore choosing $n=0$ will not weight the objects by momenta and provides a pure geometrical measure. When $d_{ij}$ is smaller than $d_{iB}$ both objects $i$ and $j$ are combined and both quantities are calculated again. At some point, $d_{iB}$ will be smaller than any $d_{ij}$, then object $i$ is called a jet and is removed from the list of objects. This procedure is repeated until the list of objects is empty. With the anti-$k_T$ jet algorithm, particles with large transverse momenta are clustered first because $d_{ij}$ (Eq. \ref{eq:dij}) is easily smaller then $d{iB}$ for large $p_T$. The resulting jets are very circular.

\subsection{HOTVR Jet Algorithm}
	Another approach to cluster jets is the 'heavy object tagger with variable R' (HOTVR) \cite{hotvr}. This algorithm does not use a constant radius parameter $R$ but a $p_T$ dependent effective $R=R_\text{eff}(p_T)$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:HOTVR}). Thus the $R_\text{eff}$ decreases with increasing $p_T$ leading to smaller jets when the decay products are expected to be more close because of the Lorentz boost. The $p_T$ dependence is scaled with a parameter $\rho$ with a default value of $600\;\text{GeV}$. Furthermore, upper and lower boundaries for the jet radius can be set. The default values are $R_\text{min} = 0.1$ and $R_\text{max} = 1.5$. 	
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HOTVR}
	  R_\text{eff} =
	   \begin{cases}
	     R_\text{min} & \text{for } \rho / p_T < R_\text{min} \\
	     R_\text{max} & \text{for } \rho / p_T > R_\text{max} \\
	     \rho / p_T & \text{else}  
	   \end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent This effective $R$ is then used with the equations of the Anti-$k_T$ algorithm described earlier (see Eq. \ref{eq:dij} - \ref{eq:iB}). Additionally, a mass-jump criterion is used.

\subsection{XCone Jet Algorithm}
\label{sec:xcone}
	XCone \cite{xcone} is an exclusive jet algorithm, returning conical jets. It is well suited for analysis where the final state and therefore the expected number of jets is known since it returns a fixed number of jets. Thus, a physical final state has direct influence on the jet finding. \\
	Starting with a fixed number of jet axes $N$ the algorithm calculates the direction of these axes by minimizing the N-jettiness variable. N-jettiness is a measure for how N-jet-like an event looks. The definition is shown in Eq. \ref{njettines}.
	\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\tau}_N = \sum_i \min\{\rho_\text{jet}(p_i, n_1), \dots, \rho_\text{jet}(p_i, n_N), \rho_\text{beam}(p_i)\}
	\label{njettines}
	\end{equation}
	Once the minimizing process converges, all particles inside a radius $R$ from a jet axis are added to one jet. Here, it is important to mention that XCone handles overlapping jets differently than common iterative jet algorithms. HOTVR and the Anti-$k_T$ algorithm remove already clustered objects from the input list. Thus, one of two nearby jets is crescent shaped while the other one is circular. XCone however, will assign every object to the closest jet resulting in a straight border between two jets. This feature is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:XCone_overlap}. 
	\begin{figure}[tb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics [width=.6\textwidth]{../Plots/XCone_Overlap.png}
		\caption{The separation of nearby jets clustered with the XCone jet algorithm in a $t\bar{t}$ event, requiring six jets with a radius of $0.5$, is depicted. The area of jets is shown in the $\phi$-$y$-plane. Here $y$ indicates the rapidity. Taken from \cite{xcone}.}
		\label{fig:XCone_overlap}
	\end{figure} 
	A more general advantage of XCone is that the N-jettiness variable is often used to do theory calculations of particle physics events, the XCone algorithm is easier to include in these calculations.
	
\subsection{Jet Energy Corrections}
\label{sec:jec}
	Jets found by clustering sequences are furthermore corrected to account for non linearities in the detector response and differences between data and simulation because of modelling \cite{JEC}. The approach is to factorize different sources of variance and scale momentum vectors of jets with a factor addressing each source. Thus, four factors are introduced which then result in one final $p_T$ and $\eta$ dependent correction factor as shown in Eq. \ref{eq:jec} and \ref{eq:cjec}.
	\begin{equation}
	p^{\text{corrected}} = C_{\text{JEC}} \cdot p^{\text{raw}}
	\label{eq:jec}
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation}
	C_{\text{JEC}} = C_{\text{offset}} \cdot C_{\text{MC}} \cdot C_{\text{rel}} \cdot C_{\text{abs}}
	\label{eq:cjec}
	\end{equation}
	Firstly, a factor is applied to address the additional energy in a jet because of pile-up ($C_{\text{offset}}$), which is not taken care of in simulation. The factor is constructed $p_T$ dependent to subtract a constant energy from a jet in data. Secondly, reconstructed jets are corrected to match the generated jet momentum. This is done by calculating a factor $R=\frac{p_T^{\text{rec}}}{p_T^{\text{gen}}}$ in different $p_T$ and $\eta$ regions and apply this to reconstructed jets as $C_{\text{MC}} = \frac{1}{<R>}$, where $<R>$ indicates a mean in the given region. Next, a relative correction $C_{\text{rel}}$ is applied which accounts for non linearities in the detector response. Therefore, a $\eta$ dependent correction factor is used. Lastly, an absolute factor $\cdot C_{\text{abs}}$ derived from data in $Z$ + jets and $\gamma$ + jets events to fit the absolute energy scale.

\subsection{b-Jets}
\label{sec:btag}
	In this analysis jets originating from a bottom quark are identified to reduce background. To identify a jet as an b-jet the "Combined Secondary Vertex" (CSV) algorithm is used. Since b-hadrons have a large lifetime of $1.5\;\text{ps}$ they travel about $450\;\text{\textmu m}$ in the detector before decaying. This leads to a secondary vertex at the spatial point where the hadron decays which can be reconstructed in the tracking system. Additionally the composition of hadrons in a b-jet is different from other jets.

\section{$\cancel{E}_T$ and $S_T$}
	With the information of mentioned objects two important variables are defined. The missing transverse energy $\cancel{E}_T$ is defined to estimate the energy carried away by particles which leave the experiment undetected. Summing up all transverse momenta of each particle in the final state returns the $p_T$ of the system in the initial state which is $p_T = 0$ at LHC. Thus the transverse energy of all undetected particles is defined as the absolute value of the negative sum over all transverse momenta of detected objects (Eq. \ref{eq:MET}). Since every object, independent from it's $\eta$, has to be taken into account for this variable, $\cancel{E}_T$ is independent from the selection applied. The missing energy is due to neutrinos which can not be detected with CMS because of their low probability to interact with the detector material or a new physics state. 
	
	\begin{equation}
		\cancel{E}_T = \left| - \sum_{\textrm{leptons, jets}}^{} \vec{p}_T \right|
		\label{eq:MET}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent Another important variable to describe an event is $S_T$. As represented in Eq. \ref{eq:ST} is defined as the scalar sum of all transverse momenta of reconstructed objects plus the missing transverse energy mentioned above. Different from $\cancel{E}_T$ only objects surviving the selection are considered. $S_T$ gives an estimate how much energy one event contains and is therefore used to distinguish between low energy QCD and high energy processes. 
	
	\begin{equation}
		S_T = \left( \sum_{\textrm{leptons, jets}}^{} \vert \vec{p}_T \vert \right) + \cancel{E}_T
		\label{eq:ST}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent Additionally, a definition for $S_T$ which just takes leptonic activity into account is used in this analysis. It is similarly defined and referred to as $S_T^{\text{lep}}$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:STlep}).
	
	\begin{equation}
		S_T^\text{lep} = \left( \sum_{\textrm{leptons}}^{} \vert \vec{p}_T \vert \right) + \cancel{E}_T
		\label{eq:STlep}
	\end{equation}
